# The FreeFrom CookBook

![Mock ups](static/images/readme_images/mock_ups.png)

The FreeFrom CookBook is an online recipe book specifically catering for those with food allergies and intollerances. Last year I was diagnosed with a severe gluten-intollerance. Understanding free-from cooking, scrutinising labels and educating friends and family has quickly become part of my everyday life. I wanted to create a site where people could explore, create and share allergen free recipes in one place and help educate and promote the importance of understanding food allergies and intollerances amongst everyone. Food allergies can be isolating and stressful, so I wanted to create something with a community-feel and help make free-from cooking more easily accessible.

The FreeFrom CookBook has been developed for my Backend Development Milestone 3 Project, as part of my Full Stack Software Development Diploma with Code Insitute. 

Deployed site can be viewed [here](https://the-freefrom-cookbook.onrender.com/)

## Scope Plane

### **Existing Features**
1. Design
    - Simple, clean design and layout with consistency throughout.
    - Easy navigation by using navigation bar. Nav links are clearly idenfied both on desktop and when sidenav is expanded on smaller devices.
    - Responsive design allowing users to use site across all devices.
2. Recipes
    - Recipes can be created, read, updated and deleted (CRUD) by the users.
    - On the create recipe form, the pre-populated allergen dropdown prompts users to select one or more allergens. The purporse of this is to ensure that users check what allergens their recipe is free from before uploading.
    - Users of the site, either logged in or not, can search the recipes either by text input and/or filtering what allergens they want the recipe to be free from.
    - Logged in users can favourite recipes and save them to their profile.
    - Logged in users can save ingredients from recipe pages to their "shopping list" on their profile.
    - Logged in users have access to their profile, where they can view favourite recipes, recipes they uploaded and saved ingredients in their shopping list.
    - Recipe information includes servings, prep and cook times, what allergens it is free from, category, ingredients and the method.
    - Flash messages will appear when users create, edit, delete and favourite recipes and when their shopping list has been updated.
3. Register, Login and Logout
    - Users of the site can create an account.
    - Users can login into their existing account.
    - Users can logout of their account.
    - When a user logs in, logs out or creates a new account a flash message will display informing the user what has been actioned.
4. Contact and Newsletter
    - Users can contact the site owner through a contact form
    - Contact form powered by emailJS
    - On successfull delivery of a contact message, a modal will display informing the user it has been successful with a personalised message.
    - Users can sign up to a newsletter subscription
    - A flash message will display informing user either if subscription has been successful or if the email address already exists in database.

### Defensive Programming

To protect the site and defend against any "brute force", I added some defensive programming:
* Created Python functions that:
    - Check if a user is logged in. This checks if the session user is active, if so allows the user to perform the action. If not will redirect user to the appropriate page with flash message.
    - Check if it is correct user (has the permission). For example with edit recipe, this checks if the session user is equal to the created_by field in the recipe. If so, it allows the user to edit the recipe. If the check fails, it redirects the user with appropriate flash message.
    - Check if user is superuser (is admin). An admin function in the app.py defines the admin_user by checking whether the user is admin or not in the admin field in the user collection. The admin function is then used in functions such as edit and delete recipes, to allow the admin user these powers. If the check fails, the user is redirected and a flash message displayed.
* Use Jinga templating to display certain buttons:
    - Certain action buttons are only displayed to certain users, for example 'Add to favourites' is only displayed to users that are logged in and didn't create the recipe. Use of Jinga for loops and if conditions to display if users are authorised to do so. 



### **Future Features**
- A section on users home page of recipe suggestions based on type of recipes saved and created in their profile.
- Recipes to display a rating on recipe card based on the average ratings given.
- Users to have ability to edit account, including changing password.
- Users to be able to delete or edit their own comments.
- Admin to be able to edit or delete any users account and comments on recipes.

## Structure Plane
The structure of the site has been developed to enable users to access and use the site with ease.
- Home Page- accessible by all users, whether logged in or not. 
- Navbar- accessible to all users. The navbar changes to a sidenav on tablet screens and smaller for responsiveness. The options available in the navbar change depending on whether a user is logged in or not.
    * For logged in users:  
![Navbar for logged in users](static/images/readme_images/navbar_logged_in.png)
    * For not logged in users:  
![Navbar for not logged in users](static/images/readme_images/navbar_logged_out.png)
- About Page and Contact Page- accessible to all users, whether logged in or not.
- Recipes library- accessible to all users, whether logged in or not. 
- On recipe card in the recipes library and on individual recipe pages an 'Add to favourites' button is available to logged in users. This allows logged in users, that did not create the recipe, to save recipes to their profile.
- View Recipe Page- Each recipe can be viewed in full and is accessible to all users, whether logged in or not. This page has edit, delete and 'Add to favourites' buttons, 'Save to Shopping List' and a comments section.
- The edit button on the View Recipe Page, is available to admin or the user that created the recipe. This allows the user or admin to edit any part of the recipe and save it.
- The delete button on the View Recipe Page, is available to admin or the user that created the recipe. This allows the user or admin to delete the recipe from the database.
- The 'Save to Shopping List' button allows all logged in users to select ingredients in a recipe and save to a shopping list on their profile.
- Profile Page- this has the users name displayed in the welcome message. On the users profile there are buttons to create a recipe, find recipes in the library and delete account, as well as their shopping list, recipes the user has created and recipes they have saved to their favourites.
- Error Pages have been created incase a user tries to access a page that doesn't exist or there is an issue. 
![404 Error Page Example](static/images/readme_images/error_page_example.png) 
- Database schema design was created using [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home), see below.

- [User Profile Shopping List Page](static/images/readme_images/wireframes/user_profile_shopping.png)

### Changes to Wireframes
There were only a couple of changes to the wireframes during development:
- Instead of a table to display the allergens on the About Page, I decided to use a Materialize collapsible. This allows user to expand information as and when they require. It also minimises the amount of text being displayed at once, which can sometimes be overwhelming to a user.
- On the profile page, initially I was going to have a profile page with three sections(Favourites, Shopping List and My Recipes), which took the user to three different pages. I decided early on in development that this wasn't needed. I want the user to have a good experience and easily access all information. Additionally I didn't feel there would be enough content to fill 3 additional pages. It has been developed that the user has one profile page with all information displayed, clearly laid out in sections.

## Surface Plane

### Colour Scheme
During development I explored different colour palettes and options. I wanted to use a colour scheme that was both pleasing to the using, and contributed to an overall stylish and simple design. Whilst researching, I explored what different colours represent. Green is often associated with nature and is often viewed as a calming colour. I decided that I wanted my site to be a grounded experience for the user rather than overly garish or exciteable. From that, and using green as a central colour, I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/),  to determine a colour palette. 

Initially this palette was chosen:
![Colour palette](static/images/readme_images/original_coolors.png)

After further exploration and development these colours were chosen:

![Image of pink colour](static/images/readme_images/colour_pink.png)
![Image of gray colour](static/images/readme_images/colour_gray.png)
![Image of blue colour](static/images/readme_images/colour_blue.png)
![Image of liver colour](static/images/readme_images/colour_liver.png)


### Images

The images in the site have been selected to showcase delcious, inviting free-from food. To highlight, for the purposes of the site the images chosen by admin were chosen and recipes matched. It can't be guaranteed that the recipes displayed are actually allergen free recipes. 

The site consists of:
- A hero image on the Home page
- An image displaying examples of food intollerances on the About Page
- Each recipe image. 
- If the user does not upload an image, an image is provided. 

Images have been used from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/).

### Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to choose fonts for the site. Lobster was chosen as the brand logo font, with its flowing, cursive design. Roboto Condensed was chosen for the rest of the site, as it is clear and easy to read.
